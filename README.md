# axidraw-python

This was a short project in 2021, helping a friend develop a system that could allow for a letter bank of SVGs
created from a Tablet be integrated with an axidraw handwriting bot. 

Two primary goals: 
1. Being able to port a set of handwriting from anybody simple sourcing of handwriting samples from given individual. 
2. Creating variations in spacing, size, skew to replicate a slightly more organic feel.
